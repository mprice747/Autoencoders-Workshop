# Autoencoders-Workshop
This notebook contains an introduction to autoencoders and how they can be applied to a recommendation/search engine system. We first outline the basic mathematical foundations of autoencoders, and then train one for the purpose of building a fashion recommendation system. For simplicity, we will utilize the Fashion MNIST dataset. <br> <br>
